  <h1>My Contract
  <body>
<h2>I, Jack, understand that I will be given my own personal website. I understand that anything I post on this site can be accessed and seen on any computer connected to the World Wide Web. While in this class I will use the web responsibly. Anything I post on my site will contain only content appropriate for the L-S Web Server. No profanity, explicit material, material related to drugs or alcohol, or hateful content will ever appear on my L-S website. The content of my page will not be plagiarized. Any content taken from another digital or non-digital source and used in my website will be directly and clearly attributed to the source within the text of any webpage in which the content appears. My ability to abide by this contract will be partially reflected in my Web Publishing course grade. I understand that any breach of this contract may have disciplinary ramifications.
Signed,
Jack
